# legal-toolkit

A practical collection of guides, checklists, and notes for navigating law school, the LSAT, the patent bar, and legal career logistics.

This repo is basically the stuff I wish someone had handed me earlier — process notes, study tips, timelines, and small “gotchas” that aren’t obvious until you’ve done it the hard way.

Nothing fancy. Just practical documentation.

Use whatever helps.

(Informational only — not legal advice.)
