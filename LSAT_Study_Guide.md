# 🎯 Big Picture Strategy

The LSAT is:

- learnable  
- pattern-based  
- about process and repetition (not raw intelligence)

Most people can realistically gain **+8–15 points** with focused practice.

And because scholarships scale heavily with LSAT scores, **every single point has real dollar value**.

Treat this test like an investment.

# 📚 Best Study Resources

## 1) LawHub (Official Tests) — Essential

From the Law School Admission Council.

Buy **LawHub Advantage (~$120)**.

Includes:

## 2) ChatGPT — Powerful (with limits)

Great for:
- explaining missed questions
- breaking down logic
- clarifying confusing wording
- drilling conditional reasoning
- reviewing mistakes step-by-step

Less good for:
- very deep multi-layer puzzles
- perfectly matching official LSAT wording

Best use:
👉 Do real questions → paste mistakes → ask for explanations

For many people, this alone can move **150 → 160**.

## 3) Books / Courses (Pick ONE System)

Don’t stack five courses. Pick one and go deep.

### Logical Reasoning
- *The Loophole in LSAT Logical Reasoning*

### General strategy
- *The LSAT Trainer*

### Free option
- Khan Academy LSAT prep

### Structured course

👉 LawHub + one book + deep review = enough for most people.

# 📅 Study Plan That Works

## Weeks 1–2
- Learn fundamentals
- Untimed practice
- Focus on understanding concepts

## Weeks 3–6
- Timed sections daily
- Review every wrong answer
- Track mistakes

## Weeks 7–10
- Full practice tests 2–3x per week
- Simulate real conditions

Biggest gains come from:

✔ slow review  
❌ not just grinding volume

Doing 20 tests without review helps less than 5 tests with deep analysis.

# 🧪 Test Day Logistics

The LSAT is administered by **Prometric**.

Small logistics issues cause unnecessary stress — prep ahead.

## Checklist

### Login info
- Bring LSAC username/password
- You may need to re-enter multiple times

### Food rules
- Vary by site (some allow snacks, some don’t)
- Check beforehand

### Practice digital format
- highlighting
- flags
- timer
- navigation

Use **LawHub only** so the interface feels identical.

### Simulate at home
- full length
- no phone
- quiet room
- minimal breaks

### Day before
- light review only
- sleep well
- no cramming

Fatigue costs more points than missing one more practice set.

# 🔑 Final Advice

If you remember nothing else:

- Official practice tests matter most
- Review mistakes deeply
- LSAT = scholarship leverage

+5 points can mean **tens of thousands of dollars**

This is one of the few exams where deliberate practice reliably pays off.

I went through LSAT prep and the law school admissions process myself and put this guide together to document the practical strategies and small “gotchas” I wish someone had explained earlier.
